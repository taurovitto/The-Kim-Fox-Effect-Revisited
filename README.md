# The-Kim-Fox Effect (Revisited)

This is a group project for NYU Center for Urban Science and Progress course in Principles of Urban Informatics.

Authors: Vittorio Costa, Gabriel Pincus, and Branden Dupont.

We apply interrupted time series (ITS) to assess the effect of a progressive prosecutor (Kim Foxx, Cook's County State Atoorney since 2016). In particular, we focus on a policy change implemented related to the sentence level of shoplifting. This a revisited version of a previous study on the matter where the aim has been broadened. For more details, look at the report and the jupyter notebook.

Out of the whole class (approximately 200 students in groups) only our group and another group were asked to present the project to the class.
