# The-Kim-Fox Effect (Revisited)

This is a group project for NYU Center for Urban Science and Progress course in Principles of Urban Informatics.

Authors: Vittorio Costa, Gabriel Pincus, and Branden Dupont.

We apply interrupted time series (ITS) to assess the effect of a progressive prosecutor (Kim Foxx, Cook's County State Atoorney since 2016). In particular, we focus on a policy change implemented related to the sentence level of shoplifting. For more details, look at the report and the jupyter notebook.
